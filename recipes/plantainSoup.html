<h3>Soup with plenty of Vitamin C</h3>
<p>Sopa de platano (plantain soup) is a thick, starchy soup that's popular in Caribbean cuisine.</p>

<ul><h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <li>2 tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
    <li>1 Small Onion finely diced</li>
    <li>¾ – 1 cup Diced Carrots 1 – 2 carrots, depending on their size</li>
    <li>1 Celery Rib finely diced</li>
    <li>3-4 Garlic Cloves minced</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Cumin</li>
    <li>2 Large Green Plantains peeled and cut into ½ inch rounds</li>
    <li>6 cups Chicken Broth</li>
    <li>1 Bay Leaf</li>
    <li>Salt to taste if needed</li>
    <li>Chopped Cilantro or Parsley for garnish optional</li>
    <li>Crushed Plantain Chips for garnish optional</li>
    <li>Limes for serving optional</li>
</ul>

<ol><h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the onions, carrots and celery. Cook the vegetables for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and cumin and cook for 1 minute, stirring almost constantly.</li>
    <li>Add the sliced plantains and give everything a good stir.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth and the bay leaf and stir well.</li>
    <li>Raise the heat to high and bring the liquid to a boil.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat to medium-low, cover and cook the soup for 35-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. The plantains should break apart when pressed with a wood spoon, if they do not; continue cooking for 10 minutes and check again.</li>
    <li>Remove and discard the bay leaf.</li>
    <li>Taste the soup and add salt if needed. As a reference we did not add any extra salt to ours.</li>
    <li>Process the soup with an immersion blender or potato masher, if desired. Don’t process all the way, leave the soup a little chunky.</li>
    <li>Garnish the soup with chopped cilantro (or parsley) and crushed plantain chips, if desired.</li>
</ol>
