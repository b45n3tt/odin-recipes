<h3>Looking for a sandwich</h3>
<p>Jibarito is an authentic Puerto Rican sandwich made out of flattened, fried green plantains instead of bread.</p>

<ul><h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h4>For the steak:</h4>
    <li>1/2 lb skirt steak, trimmed of fat</li>
    <li>1 packet sazón</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon adobo</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>6 oz beer (optional)</li>
    <h4>For the plantains:</h4>
    <li>2 green plantains</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <h4>Suggested toppings:</h4>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Lettuce</li>
    <li>Tomato</li>
    <li>MayoKetchup</li>
</ul>

<ol><h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <h4>For the steak:</h4>
    <li>Tenderize the skirt steak by pounding with a meat mallet tenderizer. Season with sazón, adobo, garlic powder and black pepper. If using beer, place seasoned meat in a ziploc bag, cover with beer and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Grill steak over high heat until medium-rare or medium, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove from heat and let steak rest for 5-10 minutes, then slice into strips against the grain.</li>
    <h4>For the plantains:</h4>
    <li>In a large frying pan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Oil should be at least 1 inch deep.</li>
    <li>Slice the ends off the plantains. Run a knife down the length creating a shallow incision. Pry open skin to peel. Slice plantains in half.</li>
    <li>Fry in hot oil (about 350°F) until softened, but not browned, about 5-7 minutes per side. They will pierce easily with a fork when soft.</li>
    <li>Remove from oil and flatten each piece to 1/4-inch thickness. This can be done with the bottom of a heavy plate or pan. Return to oil and fry again on each side until crispy and golden yellow, about 1-2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt while hot.</li>
    <h4>Assembly:</h4>
    <li>Place half the steak on a slice of plantain, along with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayoketchup. Top with another plantain to form a sandwich. Repeat with remaining steak and plantains.</li>
