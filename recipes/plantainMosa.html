<h3>A plantain Hush Puppy</h3>
<p>Plantain mosa is one of Nigerians popular small chops served at parties. It tastes like puff puff but with the additional flavour 
    from plantain and the use of cornmeal flour instead of plain flour. Plantain mosa recipe is very simple and easy to make and of course very delicious too.</p>
<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 overripe plantain</li>
    <li>1 cup of semolina flour 250g substitute with plain flour or cornmeal flour</li>
    <li>2-3 tbsp sugar add more if you want but remember the plantain will be sweet enough</li>
    <li>1 tsp fast action yeast</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>200-250 ml warm water</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Peel the plantain, cut into manageable sizes, add to a bowl and mash until smooth then set aside till needed</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl add semolina flour, sugar, yeast and mix well until combined</li>
    <li>Add the mashed plantain to the dry ingredient, stir the warm water to the mixture in bits and mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated (make sure the batter is slightly thick)</li>
    <li>Cover the mixture with a cling film or a kitchen towel and place in the warmest part of your kitchen for 30 to 45 minutes and allow to rise</li>
    <li>Place a pan on medium-high heat, add enough oil about 3 to 4 cups and heat until hot. Drop a tiny bit of batter in hot oil to test and if the batter floats to the top of the oil, then it is ready to use. Scoop the batter, a little at a time into the oil.
