<h3>A sweet coconut, cinnamon, and plantain pudding</h3>
<p>Chucula is a delicious creamy dessert from Ecuador. It is made from ripe plantains, milk, cinnamon and vanilla. 
    It can be served as a warm or cold smoothie or as a slightly thicker pudding with ricotta cheese.</p>

  
<ul><h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <li>1 lb ripe (yellow with plenty of black spots) plantains (about 2), peeled and sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup coconut cream</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>Pinch of fine sea salt</li>
    
   <h4> FOR GARNISHING:</h4>
    <li>Whipped coconut cream</li> 
    <li>Unsweetened coconut or my favorite caramel sea salt coconut chips</li> 
</ul>

<ol><h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <li>Add the sliced plantains to a mini food processor & process to a puree, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add the coconut cream and cinnamon to the processor after scraping down the sides.</li>
    <li>Blend for another minute or so until the mixture is smooth.</li>
    <li>Divide the pudding between four 4 oz ramekins. Divide the unsweetened coconut between the dishes and top each with a pecan half before serving.</li>
    <li>Can be eaten immediately, or kept in the freezer for an hour or two after making for more of a “soft serve” texture.</li>
</ol>
